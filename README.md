## Quick Start with Docker

Docker provides a quick setup to run all services (frontend, backend, PostgreSQL, Redis, and MinIO) in isolated containers.

### Development Mode

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build
```

- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend Swagger Documentation: http://localhost:8000/docs
- PostgreSQL Database: port 5432
- Redis: port 6379
- MinIO S3 API: port 9000 &nbsp;·&nbsp; MinIO Console: http://localhost:9001 (user/pass `minioadmin`)

### Production Mode

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

## Manual Setup

### Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

For detailed page structures and configurations, refer to the [Frontend Documentation](frontend/README.md).

### Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv

# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate

# Linux / macOS
# source venv/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

For database schemas, entity relationship diagrams, and API endpoints, refer to the [Backend Documentation](backend/README.md).
